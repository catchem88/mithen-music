import { ROW_PX } from './rows';

/**
 * Watch a scrolling container: its scroll position, its height, and how tall one row actually is.
 *
 * Row height is measured rather than assumed, which `ROW_PX` alone got wrong. The same `TrackRow`
 * is 56px on a playlist page and 72px in the 320px-wide queue panel. It used to vary within one
 * list as well, because `content-visibility` makes a row report its `contain-intrinsic-size`
 * (3.5rem) while it is skipped and its real height once it has been rendered; reserving 56px for
 * rows that draw at 72px made the scroll height move as you scrolled, which is exactly the thing
 * that makes a windowed list feel broken. Neither list that windows asks for `content-visibility`
 * any more (`TrackRow`'s `lazy`), so that half is gone, but the per-list difference remains.
 *
 * Rows opt in with `data-row`, so this measures a row and not whatever markup happens to be first.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     const sc = rowScroller();
 *     const win = $derived(rowWindow(sc.scrollTop, sc.viewportPx, items.length, sc.rowPx));
 *     <div class="overflow-y-auto" {@attach sc.attach}> … <div data-row> … </div> … </div>
