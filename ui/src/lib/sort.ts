// Playlist sorting. Pure so it can be checked without a DOM (`sort.check.ts`).

// page asks it for an ordered list instead of ordering one here (see `PlaylistPage.sortMenu`). The
// list then reads the same way in MithenMusic, in YouTube Music, and in any other client on the
// account. `sortSongs` below is the fallback for the two things YouTube cannot do — rank by our own
// play counts, and reverse a playlist's stored order — plus lists it offers no menu for at all.

 * Liked Music arrives most-recently-liked first, every other playlist arrives oldest-added first.
 *

 * order, and a track with no album still sorts last rather than jumping to the top.
